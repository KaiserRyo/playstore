OS 10.2.x is not supported.\r\n\r\n**I'm seeing the error message [403 Forbidden] when I try to check-in my device**<br>\r\nIf you see that message in Blackberry Google ID, you have either entered a wrong password or you are using 2-Step Verification with your Google account. Assuming that you have entered the correct password, you now have two options:\r\n\r\na) Turn off 2-Step Verification for your Google account here: https://myaccount.google.com/security#signin. Then enter your normal Google email password in Blackberry Google ID to login. This is the easiest way to get it running.\r\nOR\r\nb) Create an app specific password for the Blackberry Google ID app and use that password to login from Blackberry Google ID. \r\n\r\n**I'm seeing the message \"Error while retrieving information from server [DF-DFERH-01]\"**<br>\r\nThis error may occour if Google changes something on their servers and the Play Store app did not sync correctly. It is a well know issue that also happens on Android devices. To fix this problem, go to Blackberry Settings -> App Manager -> Device Monitor -> Storage -> Play Store and click on \"Clear Data\". This will clear the cache and fix the problem.\r\n\r\n**Play Store is randomly poping up and wants to install updates for my apps**<br>\r\nBy default Play Store automatically downloads updates for your installed apps. This causes Play Store to pop up when an update was successfully downloaded. This is not a bug! If you don't like that behaviour, you can turn off autoupdate in Play Store settings -> Automatic app updates. You will then just receive a notification in Blackberry Hub and Play Store won't download updates automatically. You can manually fetch the updates in the apps section of Play Store settings. \r\n\r\n**I downloaded an app from Play Store and now it's asking for Google Play Services**<br>\r\nGoogle Play services is a Framework that is provided by Google to help developers to speed up and simplify app development. Some apps that you download from Play Store may require Google Play services (mostly apps from Google, apps that display some kind of geographic map and apps that require Google+ login). These apps can be patched and will work to a certain extent. Read this post for more details:\r\nCobalt's official Google Apps landing page\r\n\r\n**Are you logging my account data or stealing my money?**<br>\r\nI can assure that no data is logged or transferred anywhere else than to the Google servers. Your data and your money is secure.\r\n\r\n**Is this all for free?**<br>\r\nYes, it is! But please consider that I've spent hundreds of hours doing the reverse engineering of all this stuff, patching it, rewriting code and testing it. So if you really appreciate my work, I would be happy if you donate a few bucks. But it's up to you.\r\n\r\n[Support my work with a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=cobalt232%40bluewin%2ech&lc=CH&item_name=Support%20Cobalt%27s%20work%20by%20donating%20a%20few%20bucks&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TRANSLATIONS\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYou can help to enhance the usability of Blackberry Google ID app by providing translations for the user interface.
